## Creating the React application
First, make sure you are in the root directory. And run the following command:
```console
npx create-next-app@latest frontend
```
Make sure the Node.js is installed. We are using 16.13.0. Or you can download it from here.

## Spin up the development server
To start the development server use the following commands:
```console
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
You must see the default react page on http://localhost:3000/.
